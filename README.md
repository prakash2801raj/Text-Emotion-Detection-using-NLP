# Text Emotion Detection and Classification

## Project Overview

This project is a web application designed for text emotion detection and classification using Streamlit and Python. With the increasing accessibility of social media platforms, emotions are often conveyed through tweets, Instagram, and WhatsApp stories. This application aims to classify emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, shame, and neutral based on the input text using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Features

-Simple and user-friendly interface for inputting text.

-Accurate classification of emotions using NLP techniques.

-Real-time processing and results visualization.

-Developed with Streamlit for seamless interaction.


## Tools and Technologies Used

-Python: For backend logic and NLP processing.

-Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.

-Natural Language Processing (NLP): For emotion classification.

-Dataset: Used for training the model.


## Dataset

The model was trained using a dataset hosted on Google Colab. You can find the dataset and training notebook here:

## How It Works

Enter a sentence or paragraph in the text input field.

The application processes the input and predicts the corresponding emotion.

Results are displayed in real time on the screen.
